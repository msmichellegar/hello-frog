# Hello Frog

This is a mini HTML/CSS challenge, taking you to the next level beyond a classic "Hello world!". You'll be styling a basic page that looks like this:

## Where to start

Before you do anything, you'll need an HTML and a CSS file. Make sure you remember to link to the CSS file in the `<head>` of the HTML document. To view your work, open the HTML file in a browser.

## The HTML

You will need the following:

* An `h1` tag with the text "Hello frog!"
* An `img` tag linking to [the following picture](http://images.clipartpanda.com/cartoon-20clip-20art-frog-cartoon-clipart.jpg)

## The CSS

Your page needs to be styled according to the following rules:

* The entire page (known as the `body`) needs to have a background coloured `#8AC73E`, and all content needs to be centred
* The "Hello frog!" text needs to be in Arial, 60px big, and in the colour `#006837`
* The frog image needs to have a height of 400px, and a solid black border that is 3px wide

## Stretch Goals

Finish early? Here are some extra challenges:

* Link your image to [frog.com](http://frog.com), so that the website opens when you click the frog
* Make the text all caps using the CSS `text-transform` property
* Put 2px of spacing in between every character of the text using the CSS `letter-spacing` property
* Change the colour of the text when you hover over it
